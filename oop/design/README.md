# Fundamental Design Principles in Object-oriented Programming

- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Decomposition
- Generalization

## Design Principles

### Abstraction

- Example of how a car object could be abstracted in different contexts

- Food objects in a grocery store and health context are represented differently

- In the above figure, we use UML class diagrams to represent the differences between abstractions in 2 cases.

- A UML class diagram consists of 3 parts
    - Top part defines the name of the class
    - The middle part defines the attributes of the class
    - The bottom part defines the behaviors of the class

### Decomposition


### Generalization
